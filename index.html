        <p class="interests2">I have a delightful variety of interests, in no particular order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Programming - clearly!</li>
          <li>Reading - Latest Science findings and Sci-Fi/RPG fiction</li>
          <li>Cats - I love the way they walk and their furry paws!</li>
          <li>Games - Whether video, tabletop, or just in conversation!</li>
          <li>Art - While I'm not an artist myself, I love to appreciate it!</li>
          <li>Music - This may be surprising, but I listen to music! Typically listen to rock, although that genre seems
            rather flexible.</li>
          <li>Learning - I'm not talking whiteboard and erasers, but in a general sense I love learning about new
            subjects, especially those related to science and programming!</li>

        deserves. Whether he demands it by serenading you with hours of music at 6am or by laying on your face while
        you
        sleep, depends on the day.

            src="img/island.jpg"></a>This was a project I started to document the rather grand DND-Esque adventure/rpg
        my roommate and I had been enjoying for several months when I began to learn HTML, I did this project during my
        first week with Epicodus.</p>

      <h3 class="project">About Me</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p class="project2">Born in Florida, my family moved around alot while I was growing up, I moved from Crystal
        River, FL to Orlando, FL when I was 6, then we moved to Hemingway, SC when I was 9. We stayed in SC until I was
        16, where we moved to Boise, ID. <br></br>
        I graduated Timberline High School in 2013, briefly entered the U.S Air Force
        in 2014 where I discovered I had an unfortunate physical disability in my legs known as chronic-compartment
        syndrome. After 2 months of heartbreak I was sent home from the military, several years of therapy and surgery
        later, I reapplied to all branches of the military in 2016 and was denied entry.<br></br>Since then I have
        pursued increasingly technical careers through assorted call centers, moved out, and in 2018 I moved from Boise,
        ID to Portland, OR where I got a last job in a call center that got briefly technical enough to sate my thirst
        for an interesting job. Now I am persuing a more technical career in programming and development in hopes of a
        career with excellent remote potential and interesting daily activities<br></br>Cody Fritz<br></br>Email:
